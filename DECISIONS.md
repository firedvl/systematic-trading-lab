# Architecture decisions

## 2026-08-02 — Standalone typed Python package

- Decision: use Python 3.12+, a `src` layout, uv, ruff, mypy, and pytest.
- Context: the repository starts empty and needs a small inspectable base.
- Alternatives: a large trading framework or notebook-first layout.
- Reasoning: explicit modules keep system assumptions testable without adopting a framework's hidden semantics.
- Consequences: the project owns its core behavior; more code arrives only with a milestone need.
- Revisit when: a component has a measured need that a mature library meets without becoming authoritative.

## 2026-08-02 — Standard-library boundaries first

- Decision: use frozen dataclasses, `Decimal`, canonical JSON, argparse, and SQLite. Store the initial fixture dataset as canonical JSON Lines.
- Context: M0 and the safe M1 slice need deterministic evidence without a large runtime dependency.
- Alternatives: Pydantic, Click, SQLAlchemy, and Parquet/PyArrow immediately.
- Reasoning: standard-library types cover the current validated boundaries and make bootstrap setup smaller.
- Consequences: JSON Lines is not the long-term columnar research format; manifests isolate storage format and schema versions.
- Revisit when: real market-data volume makes columnar scans material; adopt Parquet/PyArrow before the Alpaca archive grows.

## 2026-08-02 — Content-addressed immutable datasets

- Decision: derive dataset directories from a SHA-256 fingerprint of canonical normalized bars and write artifacts atomically; re-import returns the existing version.
- Context: evidence must not be silently overwritten and identical inputs must reproduce.
- Alternatives: mutable named files or database blobs.
- Reasoning: content addressing makes deduplication, integrity checks, and catalog reconstruction direct.
- Consequences: corrected data becomes a new version; metadata that varies by retrieval is outside the data fingerprint.
- Revisit when: remote object storage requires a different atomic publication protocol.

## 2026-08-03 — XNYS calendar for session completeness

- Decision: use `exchange-calendars` with the XNYS calendar for expected daily sessions.
- Context: weekday checks accept U.S. market holidays as valid bars.
- Alternatives: a weekday-only rule or a hand-maintained holiday list.
- Reasoning: the maintained calendar captures holidays and shortened-session schedules without duplicating dates in this repository.
- Consequences: calendar version is part of the locked environment; missing expected sessions reject a dataset.
- Revisit when: a point-in-time calendar policy or multi-venue universe requires explicit calendar ownership.

## 2026-08-03 — Read-only Alpaca HTTP boundary

- Decision: use a small stdlib `urllib` adapter for historical bars and keep credentials at the CLI environment boundary.
- Context: M1 needs provider access but must not introduce broker authority or make an SDK authoritative.
- Alternatives: `alpaca-py` or direct broker integration.
- Reasoning: the endpoint is narrow, pagination is explicit, and the adapter is easy to mock and keep read-only.
- Consequences: endpoint response mapping is owned and tested here; later broker execution remains a separate module.
- Revisit when: paper execution needs broker functionality that cannot be isolated behind the same provider boundary.
