# Operations

1. Set `TRADING_LAB_HOME` to an isolated writable directory when the default is unsuitable.
2. Run `trading-lab doctor`; stop on any failed check.
3. Import offline fixtures with `trading-lab data import-fixture`.
4. Inspect `trading-lab status`, `data describe`, and `data validate`.
5. Preserve the dataset directory and manifest together when moving evidence.

Recovery: artifact directories are authoritative. After moving a disposable `catalog.sqlite3` aside, run `trading-lab data rebuild-catalog`. Never edit an artifact in place. There is no broker process, cancel action, or live recovery procedure in this phase.
